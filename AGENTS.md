# RP1-GPCLK-DKMS repository instructions

These instructions apply to the entire project unless a more specific nested
`AGENTS.md` overrides them.

## Scope and authority

- Inspect the current files and applicable contracts before acting. Once Git is
  initialized, also inspect the branch, working tree, remotes, and relevant
  history before making changes.
- Preserve all existing work. Do not discard, reset, clean, stash, overwrite,
  stage, commit, amend, rebase, push, publish, or create a pull request unless
  explicitly authorized.
- Keep work within the requested phase. Do not silently advance from offline
  design or compilation into installation, binding, GPIO, transmission, or RF
  activity.
- Distinguish implemented behavior, planned behavior, non-goals, unresolved
  decisions, and validation still required.
- Prefer the smallest maintainable change that satisfies the current contract.

## Authoritative contracts and project boundary

- Read `docs/contracts/rp1-gpclk-dkms-module-contract.md` before architecture,
  implementation, packaging, compatibility, installation, or target work.
- This repository owns the RP1 kernel module, canonical UAPI, device-tree
  overlays, DKMS packaging, compatibility metadata, module lifecycle tooling,
  and module-specific tests and releases.
- `WsprryPi/WSPR-Transmitter` owns its userspace adapter and translation into
  the UAPI. `WsprryPi/WsprryPi` owns application policy, configuration,
  scheduling, installer orchestration, operator workflow, and product
  qualification.
- Do not vendor WsprryPi application source here. Do not copy this complete
  module source tree into WsprryPi.
- Coordinate repositories only through tagged artifacts, the canonical UAPI,
  compatibility manifests, and explicit cross-repository validation.

## Licensing

- Follow `LICENSE.md` and preserve SPDX identifiers in every source file.
- Original kernel-module source should use:
  `GPL-2.0-only OR MIT`.
- The loadable module must use `MODULE_LICENSE("Dual MIT/GPL")` unless a later
  reviewed licensing decision changes the source license consistently.
- Original project tooling, tests, and documentation should use MIT where they
  are independent of GPL-only kernel material.
- Canonical userspace-visible UAPI headers should use:
  `(GPL-2.0-only WITH Linux-syscall-note) OR MIT`.
- Imported or adapted material retains its license and provenance. Review
  compatibility before copying code; do not remove upstream notices.
- Do not claim that an SPDX tag or `MODULE_LICENSE()` resolves whether adapted
  code is derivative. Escalate uncertain provenance or licensing questions.

## Kernel and hardware safety

Unless the user explicitly authorizes the exact operation, do not:

- install, load, bind, unbind, unload, or replace a kernel module;
- apply or remove a device-tree overlay;
- run DKMS installation or removal;
- use `sudo` for a mutating action;
- change boot, module-signing, udev, systemd, or kernel configuration;
- change GPIO state, enable GPCLK, submit target DMA, key a transmitter, or
  produce RF output;
- reboot or shut down a Raspberry Pi; or
- run a test whose implementation has not first been inspected for hardware or
  system effects.

Compilation, static analysis, host-side unit tests, and clock-disabled target
tests are separate evidence classes. Target binding and even clock-disabled
administration require explicit authorization. Never infer hardware, timing,
cleanup, coexistence, installation, or RF qualification from a successful
build.

## Architecture and safety invariants

- Target stock Raspberry Pi kernels; do not introduce a maintained custom
  kernel dependency.
- Fail closed for unknown hardware, kernel, device tree, signing policy,
  resource identity, route, capability, or cleanup state.
- Never fall back to `/dev/mem`, raw userspace MMIO, a custom kernel, or another
  physical transmitter backend.
- Treat the stock `clk-rp1` provider as authoritative for normal clock
  operations. Do not claim the DKMS consumer recreates the historical custom
  provider lease.
- Derive and validate resources from device tree and exported kernel APIs. Do
  not make fixed physical addresses or opportunistic internal symbols product
  contracts.
- Keep the UAPI bounded, additive, versioned, route-neutral, and fail-closed.
  Never expose arbitrary physical addresses, DMA channels, register writes, or
  unrestricted programs to userspace.
- Support only explicitly allowlisted routes. GPIO4 and GPIO20 are separate
  administrative routes with independent evidence and qualification.
- Use single-owner state, bounded finite work, generation identifiers, stale
  callback rejection, and explicit terminal reasons.
- Protect open-file, platform-device, DMA callback, unbind, overlay, and module
  lifetimes explicitly. Managed allocation alone is not sufficient.
- Cancellation uses no successor plus bounded drain unless later target
  evidence proves another safe contract.
- Release only resources acquired by this module and never restore another
  consumer's state from a stale snapshot.

## Development and validation

- Follow `.editorconfig`.
- Add deterministic tests with implementation changes. Keep ordinary tests
  offline, unprivileged, network-free, hardware-free, and safe to repeat.
- Build against explicitly identified representative kernel headers. Record
  the kernel, configuration, compiler, architecture, module version, UAPI
  version, and result.
- Treat a DKMS or header build as build compatibility only; it cannot promote a
  combination beyond `Compatible-unqualified`.
- Inspect test commands before running them. Report skipped checks and
  environment limitations honestly.
- Run whitespace checks and applicable documentation/link validation before
  handoff.
- At each phase exit, perform a separate adversarial assessment against the
  contract. Reinject every failed assertion and repeat affected work.

## Documentation and release discipline

- Keep durable architecture and lifecycle decisions in `docs/`.
- Update the module contract when ownership, UAPI, compatibility, licensing,
  route, lifecycle, or distribution policy changes.
- Keep warnings precise: operator responsibility does not create technical
  isolation, and a clean run does not prove the absence of interference.
- Releases must be tagged, checksummed, reproducible from source, and accompanied
  by compatibility and provenance metadata. WsprryPi must never consume the
  moving default branch.
- A module release must precede a dependent WsprryPi release. Keep module and
  application commits, reviews, releases, and qualification claims separate.

## Completion reports

Lead with the outcome and include:

- files and behavior changed;
- checks run and exact results;
- hardware, system, GPIO, transmission, and RF work performed or explicitly
  not performed;
- licensing and documentation impact;
- unresolved validation and the next gated step; and
- Git state and whether anything was staged, committed, pushed, or published.

# Debian DKMS packaging

The canonical package is `rp1-gpclk-dkms_1.0.0-1_all.deb`. Use the
[complete candidate procedure](release-candidate.md) to build and independently
validate its exact source, package, inventory, checksums and provenance.
`dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign -b` builds only a local package, without candidate
identity or publication status.

## Package contents

One DKMS instance, `rp1-gpclk-dkms/1.0.0`, owns `rp1_gpclk_dkms` and
`rp1_route_controller`. The package stages their complete source closure below
`/usr/src/rp1-gpclk-dkms-1.0.0`: Kbuild, Makefile, rendered DKMS configuration,
consumer/controller sources, internal headers, both canonical UAPIs, both DTS
sources and the deterministic embedded-overlay generator. DKMS uses the explicit
runtime-controller profile; the consumer has its controller dependency/interlock
and no OF autoload alias. Direct ordinary source builds remain available.

Both overlays remain inactive:

- `/usr/lib/rp1-gpclk-dkms/overlays/rp1-gpclk-gpio4.dtbo`;
- `/usr/lib/rp1-gpclk-dkms/overlays/rp1-gpclk-gpio20.dtbo`.

Systemd unit files are staged directly as data; no systemd debhelper lifecycle
generator is invoked.

The package installs the route executor at `/usr/sbin/rp1-gpclk-route-manager`
and a matching `/usr/libexec/rp1-gpclk-dkms/rp1-gpclk-route-manager`, its versioned
schema, consumer documentation, read-only package preflight, explicit module-index verification and disabled socket
and service template. It creates the `rp1-gpclk-route` group if absent. It does
not enroll application accounts, create runtime bindings/journals, enable or
start a socket, reload systemd, or copy overlays into `/boot`. Firmware-overlay
installation and any route selection remain separately authorized operations.
Runtime tools, private overlays/UAPIs and the WsprryPi companion remain part of
explicit runtime deployment, not package-install effects.

The generated installation manifest inventories every data member, including
directories, modes and SHA-256. Provenance independently records root ownership,
control members and hashes. No system UAPI is installed under `/usr/include`.
No application source or qualification harness is packaged.

## Prerequisites and passive lifecycle

The package requires DKMS 3.2.2 through the 3.2 series, Python, OpenSSL,
device-tree-compiler, zstd and adduser. The DKMS bound limits native helper behavior
to the reviewed lifecycle family; older or newer families require explicit
compatibility review rather than silently inheriting passive-install claims. Before
installation, external orchestration supplies exact stock Raspberry Pi headers
for the required kernels. `BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL` uses standard exclusion
behavior for kernels outside `+rpt-rpi-2712` and `+rpt-rpi-v8`; it is a build-scope
filter, not qualification. Configuration builds every eligible installed header
tree rather than only the running/newest pair.

Pre-unpack checks reject loaded provider modules, symlinked/foreign payloads and
changed installed package files. Before DKMS effects, preflight requires absent
provider endpoints, routes, runtime/development journals and owned application
inhibitors. Unknown boot includes or existing firmware route nodes require
administrator review. DKMS configuration must be static and use canonical trees;
nonempty `modprobe_on_install`, `post_transaction` or `symlink_modules`, and
package-specific override files, are refused. Even the string `false` is
nonempty to DKMS. Dynamic configuration is not executed by the guard.

For signing-capable effective DKMS header configurations, the guard requires an existing administrator
key and certificate before DKMS can generate replacements. Filesystem keys must
be root-owned mode 0600; public certificates must be root-owned and not writable
by group/others. The guard neither reads private key bytes nor creates keys.
Unrecognized signing mechanisms need separate review. See [signing](signing.md).

Installation never selects a route, loads either module, applies an overlay,
changes boot files, operates a service, opens an endpoint or submits output.
Output is unavailable because neither provider module is loaded and no route
is selected. This does not change the immutable production load-time default.

## Transitions, removal and rollback

The supported transition policy is [package lifecycle and recovery](package-lifecycle.md).
The authoritative `0.9.0` predecessor is
`a1cb772107ba46f626b67af0b83a45c7b54ede78`. Its legacy package owns only the
ordinary consumer and has boot-overlay/systemd lifecycle effects. Direct upgrade
and downgrade are refused. Use owning predecessor cleanup/removal before clean
`1.0.0` installation; rollback likewise removes the successor before reinstalling
the exact retained predecessor. Never submit an old archive over an installed
successor. Debian runs an outgoing prerm before an incoming preinst, so the
read-only transition preflight must precede dpkg/APT.

Repeated installation and same-version reinstall rebuild the attributable named
DKMS instance across all eligible installed kernels. Incoming preinst embeds the
exact new read-only guard. Complete dpkg data hashes, modes, private directories,
DKMS source/kernel links and installed/cache ELF identities must agree. Present
modified or foreign objects are preserved through refusal; missing data may be
restored by an exact reinstall. Removal and purge retain administrator signing
material, trust, shared configuration, the route group and unrelated state.
Runtime/development/application-owned records require their owning cleanup first.

The maintained disposable Linux harness exercises real dpkg/APT and native DKMS;
command failures and header signing/compression variants are recorded separately.
It does not establish target module loading, service-manager behavior, trust
enforcement, application acceptance or RF qualification.

Target-built modules are not package payloads. For each installed kernel and
both module names, record the actual `.ko`, `.ko.xz`, `.ko.gz`, `.ko.zst` or
`.ko.bz2` file SHA-256 separately from the decompressed ELF SHA-256, build note,
vermagic and signing identity. Stripping, signing and compression are explicit
target transforms. The release manifest does not fabricate those values.

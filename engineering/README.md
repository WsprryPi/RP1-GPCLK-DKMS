# Engineering reference

The published [operator handbook](../docs/index.md) covers WsprryPi-managed
installation, route control, status and recovery. This directory holds the
technical contracts and procedures needed to maintain the provider.

## Start with the management profile

Read the [module contract](contracts/rp1-gpclk-dkms-module-contract.md) first.
Identify the installed profile before choosing tools: the shared socket name
does not make their protocols or recovery records interchangeable.

| Profile | Entry point and evidence | Administration boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Packaged boot-route executor | `/usr/sbin/rp1-gpclk-route-manager`; contract `rp1-gpclk-route-manager` | Owns a delimited boot block and reboot/reconciliation transactions. It is not the runtime switching protocol. |
| Passive source-development manager | `development-route-manager`; exact source/module binding and current-boot adoption | Its socket accepts passive `query` only. Installing, adopting or rolling back that binding are separate administrator mutations. Adoption does not make firmware overlays removable. |
| Runtime manager | `runtime_provider.py` facade and `runtime_route_client.py`; binding v3, readiness v1 and runtime socket schema v3 | Deploys and activates neutral administration separately from route selection. Switching, removal and recovery have different application outcomes. |

The Debian package installs source and inactive administration files. It does
not deploy or activate the runtime profile. WsprryPi normally orchestrates that
profile; standalone maintainers need the complete
[runtime workflow](operations/runtime-manager-workflow.md), not individual copied
scripts. Package ownership, source-development enrollment and runtime binding
are separate records.

For hardware-free work, start with [testing](testing.md#run-the-offline-checks).
For an existing WsprryPi installation, use the operator handbook before reaching
for lower-level tools. Command examples with mutation are alternatives for a
reviewed state, not a script to execute in sequence.

# How RP1 support works

WsprryPi prepares the signal and schedules transmissions. RP1-GPCLK-DKMS
controls the Pi's RP1 GPCLK0 output using the stock Raspberry Pi clock driver.
The module accepts finite tone and gap sequences and permits one execution
owner at a time. Cancellation prevents further chunks and drains bounded
work before cleanup.

## The parts you may see

| Part | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| WsprryPi | Installation, setup, scheduling, signal planning and operator controls |
| DKMS | Builds the modules for eligible installed Raspberry Pi kernel headers |
| `rp1_gpclk_dkms` | Executes bounded signal sequences on the selected route |
| `rp1_route_controller` | Manages the route's device-tree lifecycle |
| Route manager | Coordinates route changes and WsprryPi service restoration |
| `/dev/rp1-gpclk` | Root-only execution endpoint, normally present when a route is selected |

The stock `clk-rp1` driver remains the clock provider. No custom kernel is
required. Unknown resource identity, conflicting ownership or an uncertain
cleanup result blocks operation.

## Installation, route selection and transmission

These are separate operations:

1. **Package installation** places source and inactive overlays on the system
   and builds modules. It does not load a module or select a GPIO route.
2. **Neutral activation** establishes managed administration without a
   transmission route. The execution endpoint is absent.
3. **Route selection** connects one managed GPIO route. A saved RP1 route can
   also be restored by the owning WsprryPi installer or startup workflow.
4. **Transmission** requires WsprryPi's separate readiness, ownership and
   operation checks and the operator's deliberate request.

A route is the selected signal path, not an antenna connection or proof of
RF suitability. GPIO4 and GPIO20 need separate wiring and support evidence.

## Software and support limits

The published provider software is **v1.0.0**, Debian package **1.0.0-1**.
Maintenance branches can retain that version while their source differs from
the immutable release. WsprryPi verifies exact source and artifact identities;
matching a version string alone is insufficient.

The separate `qualification-v1.0.0-r1` supplement records scoped evidence for
each route. Its finite conducted TONE cases at 14,097,100 Hz, 2 mA and nominal
200 MHz `pll_sys` do not establish every kernel, board, frequency, mode or RF
chain. A successful DKMS build establishes build compatibility only.

Use [WsprryPi's band qualification guidance](https://wsprry-pi.readthedocs.io/)
for application band and mode choices. The provider's structural compatibility,
current readiness and externally established qualification are separate facts;
[status](status.md) explains how to read them.
